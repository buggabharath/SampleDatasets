# SampleDatasets
Working on Sample Dataset in Machine Learning 
Mainly focused on Keys representation and Shapes
## dict_keys(['target_names', 'features_names', 'DESCR', 'data', 'target'])

# Sample Datasets:
  Synthetic(made-up) two classification dataset in the forge dataset, which has two features
  code creates a scatter plot visualizing all of the data points in the dataset x and y axiz
  each data point is represented as one dot and color and shape of the dot indicates its class

## Mglearn
Imported Datasets like load_forge and load_wave 
in sampleProject1 and 2
created discreate scatter plot for visualizing data

## Scikit Learn
Import Datasets like load_beast_cancer and load_bostan
in sampleProject3 and 4
